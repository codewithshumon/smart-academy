## A Message to Alumni

```
Dear Smart Academy Alumni,

You walked our halls as students.
You sat in these classrooms, prayed in this musalla, played on these grounds.
You learned Quran here, discovered your passions here, found lifelong friends here.
You became who you are, in part, because of your time at Smart Academy.

Now, Smart Academy needs you.

Not just your donations (though those help).
Not just your time (though that's valuable).

We need your stories.
We need your inspiration.
We need you to show current students what's possible.

When a student sees you succeed as a Muslim professional—
Balancing faith and career, prayer and deadlines, values and ambitions—
They believe they can too.

When you mentor a struggling student—
Sharing your own challenges and how you overcame them—
You give them hope.

When you give back—whether BDT 500 or BDT 50,000—
You're not just supporting the school.
You're paying forward the opportunity you received.

Smart Academy shaped you.
Now help shape Smart Academy's future.

Your alma mater is calling.
Will you answer?

JazakAllah Khair for all you do.
We're proud of every single one of you.

Welcome home, Smart Achiever. ðŸ¤²
```
