## Teaching Methodologies

### 1. Play-Based Learning Spectrum

Our approach uses a continuum of play types:

**Free Play (Child-Initiated)**
*Description:* Children choose materials, activities, and play partners
*Teacher Role:* Observer, facilitator, occasional participant
*Purpose:* Social development, creativity, self-regulation, interests
*Example:* Block area, dramatic play, art station
*Time Allocation:* 30-40% of day

**Guided Play (Adult-Supported)**
*Description:* Teacher structures environment and materials around learning goals while children maintain agency
*Teacher Role:* Designer of experience, guide, co-player
*Purpose:* Skill development within playful context
*Example:* Math manipulatives with teacher guidance, science exploration with targeted questions
*Time Allocation:* 25-35% of day

**Games (Rule-Based)**
*Description:* Structured activities with clear rules and objectives
*Teacher Role:* Instructor, referee, participant
*Purpose:* Following rules, strategic thinking, social skills
*Example:* Board games, card games, musical chairs
*Time Allocation:* 10-15% of day

**Playful Instruction**
*Description:* Teacher-directed lessons made engaging through playful elements
*Teacher Role:* Instructor using playful techniques
*Purpose:* Direct teaching of specific skills
*Example:* Letter sounds through movement, math concepts through songs
*Time Allocation:* 15-20% of day

**Direct Instruction**
*Description:* Explicit teaching of specific skills or concepts
*Teacher Role:* Instructor providing clear explanations and modeling
*Purpose:* Foundational skills that benefit from direct teaching
*Example:* Quran recitation, letter formation, number writing
*Time Allocation:* 10-15% of day

### 2. Learning Centers Approach

**Purpose:** Child-choice, exploration, practice, social interaction

**Implementation:**
- 6-8 centers in each classroom

**Center Types:**
1. Literacy Center: Reading, writing, letter activities
2. Math Center: Manipulatives, games, problem-solving
3. Science/Discovery: Exploration, experimentation, nature
4. Art/Creative: Open-ended materials, expression
5. Dramatic Play: Role-play, imagination, social skills
6. Blocks/Construction: Building, spatial reasoning, cooperation
7. Islamic/Quran Corner: Recitation, Islamic books, prayer
8. Sensory/Fine Motor: Manipulative skills, tactile experiences

**Teacher Role During Centers:**
