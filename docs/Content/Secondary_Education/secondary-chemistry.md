## Important Formulas and Equations Summary

### Calculations

**Mole Concept:**
- n = m / M (moles = mass / molar mass)
- Number of particles = n × Nₐ (Nₐ = 6.02 × 10²³)
- % composition = (Mass of element / Molecular mass) × 100%

**Stoichiometry:**
- Use balanced equation ratios
- Convert: mass → moles → ratio → moles → mass

**Percentage Yield:**
- % yield = (Actual / Theoretical) × 100%

### Key Reactions to Memorize

**Acids and Bases:**
- Acid + Base → Salt + Water
- Acid + Metal → Salt + H₂
- Acid + Carbonate → Salt + H₂O + CO₂

**Metal Reactions:**
- Metal + Oxygen → Metal oxide
- Metal + Water/Steam → Metal oxide/hydroxide + H₂
- Reactive metal + Salt → Metal + Salt (displacement)

**Combustion:**
- Hydrocarbon + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O (complete)
- Hydrocarbon + O₂ → CO/C + H₂O (incomplete)

**Corrosion:**
- Iron + Oxygen + Water → Hydrated iron oxide (rust)
