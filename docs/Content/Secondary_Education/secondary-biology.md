**Immune System:**
- **White Blood Cells:**
  - **Phagocytes:** Engulf and digest pathogens (non-specific)

**Immune Response:**
1. Pathogen enters body (antigen present)
2. Lymphocytes recognize antigen
3. Specific lymphocytes multiply
4. Produce antibodies
5. Antibodies bind to antigens, neutralize or mark for destruction
6. **Memory cells** remain (long-term immunity)

**Active Immunity:**
- **Natural:** Getting disease, body produces antibodies
- **Artificial:** Vaccination (weakened/dead pathogen or parts)
  - Stimulates antibody production without disease
  - Memory cells provide protection

**Passive Immunity:**
- **Natural:** Antibodies from mother (placenta, breast milk)
- **Artificial:** Antibody injection (immediate, temporary)

**Vaccination:**
- Major public health achievement
- Eradicated smallpox, nearly eradicated polio
- Routine vaccinations (measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, etc.)
- **Herd immunity:** When enough people immune, disease can't spread

4. **Treatment and Prevention**

**Antibiotics:**
- Kill bacteria or stop growth
- Examples: Penicillin, streptomycin
- **Important:**
  - Don't work on viruses
  - Complete full course (antibiotic resistance)
  - Overuse leads to resistant bacteria

**Antibiotic Resistance:**
- Bacteria evolve resistance
- Natural selection: Resistant bacteria survive, multiply
- Major global health threat
- **Prevention:** Use antibiotics responsibly, only when needed

**Prevention Methods:**
- **Hygiene:** Handwashing (soap, water), clean food/water
- **Sanitation:** Proper sewage disposal, clean drinking water
- **Vaccination:** Immunization programs
- **Vector control:** Mosquito nets, insecticides, eliminate breeding sites
- **Quarantine:** Isolate infected individuals
- **Safe practices:** Protected sex (HIV), mask-wearing (COVID-19)
- **Healthy lifestyle:** Balanced diet, exercise, adequate sleep

**Islamic Perspective:**
- Cleanliness is half of faith (hadith)
- Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) emphasized hygiene (handwashing, oral hygiene)
- Medical treatment is encouraged
- Vaccination: Majority of scholars permit as preventive measure
- Patience during illness as test from Allah
- Visiting sick as good deed

**Practice:**
- Identifying pathogens and diseases

### Chapter 7: Ecology and Environment

**Learning Duration:** 5 weeks

**Key Concepts:**

     - **Biotic:** Living (plants, animals, microorganisms)
     - **Abiotic:** Non-living (water, air, soil, temperature, light)
   - **Types:** Forest, grassland, desert, aquatic (freshwater, marine)

2. **Food Relationships**

**Producers (Autotrophs):**
- Make own food (photosynthesis)
- Plants, algae
- Base of food chain

**Consumers (Heterotrophs):**
- **Primary consumers:** Herbivores (eat plants)
- **Secondary consumers:** Carnivores (eat herbivores)
- **Tertiary consumers:** Carnivores (eat other carnivores)
- **Omnivores:** Eat both plants and animals

**Decomposers:**
- Break down dead organisms, waste
- Bacteria, fungi
- Return nutrients to soil

**Food Chain:**
- Linear sequence showing feeding relationships
- Example: Grass → Grasshopper → Frog → Snake → Hawk
- Energy transfer one direction only
- Arrow means "eaten by"

**Food Web:**
- Interconnected food chains
- More realistic representation
- Shows multiple feeding relationships

**Trophic Levels:**
- **Level 1:** Producers
- **Level 2:** Primary consumers
- **Level 3:** Secondary consumers
- **Level 4:** Tertiary consumers
- Energy decreases at each level (~10% passed on)

**Energy Pyramid:**
- Graphical representation of energy at each trophic level
- Largest at base (producers), smallest at top (top carnivores)
- Explains why fewer top predators

**Pyramid of Numbers:**
- Number of organisms at each level

**Pyramid of Biomass:**
- Total mass of organisms at each level

3. **Nutrient Cycles**

**Carbon Cycle:**
- **Photosynthesis:** CO₂ from air → organic compounds in plants
- **Respiration:** Organic compounds → CO₂ to air (plants, animals)

- **Combustion:** Burning fossil fuels → CO₂ to air
- **Fossilization:** Organic matter → fossil fuels (millions of years)

**Nitrogen Cycle:**
- Atmosphere: 78% nitrogen gas (N₂)
- Most organisms can't use N₂ directly
- **Nitrogen Fixation:** N₂ → Ammonia/Nitrates (bacteria in soil, root nodules)
- **Absorption:** Plants take up nitrates from soil
- **Feeding:** Nitrogen compounds passed along food chain
- **Decomposition:** Dead organisms → Ammonia (bacteria)
- **Nitrification:** Ammonia → Nitrites → Nitrates (nitrifying bacteria)
- **Denitrification:** Nitrates → N₂ back to atmosphere (denitrifying bacteria)

**Water Cycle:**
- **Evaporation:** Water → Water vapor (heat from sun)
- **Transpiration:** Water vapor from plants
