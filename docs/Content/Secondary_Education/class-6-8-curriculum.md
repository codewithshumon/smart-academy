# Class 6-8 Curriculum Guide (Lower Secondary)

**Smart Academy | Building Foundation for Academic Excellence**

---

## Document Overview

This comprehensive curriculum guide details the educational program for Classes 6, 7, and 8 at Smart Academy - the critical lower secondary years that bridge primary education and SSC preparation. These three years establish the foundation for specialized study, develop independent learning skills, and prepare students for the academic rigor of Classes 9-10 and SSC examinations.

Lower secondary education represents a pivotal transition period where students move from general education to deeper subject specialization, from teacher-directed learning to independent study, and from childhood to adolescence. Our curriculum is designed to support this transition while maintaining academic excellence and Islamic character development.
