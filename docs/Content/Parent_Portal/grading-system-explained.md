## Philosophy of Assessment

### Why We Assess

**For Learning:**
- Identify what students know and can do
- Diagnose learning needs and gaps
- Inform instructional decisions
- Monitor progress over time
- Provide feedback for growth

**As Learning:**
- Help students understand their progress
- Develop self-assessment skills
- Build metacognition (thinking about thinking)
- Encourage goal-setting and reflection
- Promote ownership of learning

**Islamic Perspective:**
- Honest assessment of knowledge and skills
- Recognition that abilities are gifts from Allah
- Effort and intention matter alongside achievement
- Excellence (Ihsan) in all endeavors
- Growth as a journey, not just destination

## GPA Calculation

### Grade Point Average

**How GPA Works:**
- Each grade assigned point value (0-5.0)
- Points averaged across all subjects
- Used for overall academic standing
- May be used for eligibility and recognition

**Calculation:**
```
GPA = Total Grade Points ÷ Number of Subjects

Example:
English: A (4.0)
Mathematics: A- (3.5)
Science: B (3.0)
Islamic Studies: A (4.0)
Bengali: B+ (3.5 - if applicable)

Total Points: 4.0 + 3.5 + 3.0 + 4.0 + 3.5 = 18.0
GPA = 18.0 ÷ 5 = 3.6
```

**Weighted vs. Unweighted:**
- **Unweighted:** All courses equal weight
- **Weighted:** Advanced courses may have extra weight (if applicable)
- Smart Academy typically uses unweighted GPA

**GPA Scale:**
- **5.0:** Superior academic achievement
- **4.0-4.9:** Excellent academic achievement
- **3.5-3.9:** Good academic achievement
- **3.0-3.4:** Satisfactory academic achievement
- **2.0-2.9:** Fair academic achievement
- **Below 2.0:** Academic concern

## Interpretation and Use

### What Grades Tell Us

**Grades Indicate:**
- Level of achievement at a point in time
- Understanding of subject matter
- Completion of requirements
- Comparison to standard (not to other students)

**Grades Don't Tell:**
- Everything about a child's worth
- Potential for future success
- Effort always (sometimes effort ≠ result)
- Learning style preferences
- Character and personality
- Islamic commitment and practice

### Limitations of Grades

**Remember:**
- Grade is one measure, not the whole picture
- Some learning difficult to measure
- Tests don't capture all knowledge
- Anxiety can affect performance
- Different learning styles not always accommodated
- Growth may not show in grade immediately

**Islamic Perspective:**
- A child's value is not their grade
- Allah knows the true effort and intention
- Success in this world ≠ success in Akhirah
- Character and Taqwa more important than grades
- Every child has unique gifts from Allah
