## Islamic Foundation

### Quranic Guidance

**On Truthfulness and Honesty:**
> "O you who have believed, fear Allah and be with those who are true." (Quran 9:119)

> "Woe to those who give less [than due], who when they take a measure from people, take in full. But if they give by measure or weight to them, they give less." (Quran 83:1-3)

**On Justice and Fairness:**
> "Indeed, Allah commands you to render trusts to whom they are due and when you judge between people to judge with justice." (Quran 4:58)

### Hadith Guidance

The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said:

> "The signs of a hypocrite are three: when he speaks he lies, when he makes a promise he breaks it, and when he is entrusted with something he betrays that trust." (Sahih Bukhari)

> "He who cheats is not of us." (Sahih Muslim)

### Islamic Principles of Academic Integrity

- Truthful representation of knowledge and skills
- No deception in assessments

**3. 'Adl (Justice)**
