## Policy Overview

### Purpose Statement

Smart Academy's grading policy provides a fair, consistent, and transparent system for evaluating student academic achievement. This policy ensures:

- **Clear Standards**: Students and parents understand expectations
- **Fair Assessment**: All students evaluated by consistent criteria
- **Multiple Measures**: Grades reflect diverse demonstrations of learning
- **Growth Focus**: Emphasis on improvement and mastery
- **Islamic Values**: Character and effort recognized alongside achievement

### Guiding Principles

**1. Grading for Learning**
- Grades communicate what students know and can do
- Separation of academic achievement from behavior
- Multiple opportunities to demonstrate mastery
- Feedback-oriented for improvement

**2. Fairness and Consistency**
- Clear criteria established before assessment
- Same standards applied to all students
- Bias-free evaluation
- Accommodations for documented needs

**3. Transparency**
- Grading criteria communicated clearly
- Students understand how grades are determined
- Parents have access to grading information
- Regular updates on progress

**4. Islamic Approach**
- Recognition of effort and struggle
- Character considered alongside achievement
- Encouragement for improvement (Tawbah/renewal)
- No despair — always opportunity for improvement

## Grading Philosophy

### Islamic Perspective on Assessment

**Allah's Criterion:**

> "Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you." (Quran 49:13)

> "And that the effort is [meant] for the effort." (Quran 53:39-40)

**The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said:**

> "Actions are but by intentions, and every man shall have only that which he intended." (Sahih Bukhari & Muslim)

### Our Beliefs About Grading

1. **Grades Communicate Achievement**: Grades reflect what students have learned, not behavior or compliance

2. **Multiple Measures**: Single assessments never define a student — overall performance matters

3. **Growth Matters**: Improvement over time is valued and recognized

4. **Effort Counts**: Hard work and persistence are important indicators of character

5. **High Standards**: All students can achieve at high levels with appropriate support and time

6. **No Despair**: Poor grades are not permanent — there's always opportunity for improvement through effort and repentance

### What Grades Should Reflect

**ACADEMIC FACTORS (Graded):**
- Knowledge and understanding
- Skills application
- Critical thinking
- Problem-solving ability
- Quality of work
- Progress over time

**NON-ACADEMIC FACTORS (Not Graded, Reported Separately):**
- Behavior (reported in citizenship section)
- Effort (reported separately)
- Participation (not graded unless specified)
- Attendance (reported separately)
- Punctuality (reported separately)
