### Quranic Command for Fasting

**The Obligation of Fasting:**

**Ramadan Specification:**
> "The month of Ramadhan [is that] in which was revealed the Quran, a guidance for the people and clear proofs of guidance and criterion. So whoever sights [the new moon of] the month, let him fast it." (Quran 2:185)

**Permitted Exceptions:**
> "So whoever witnesses [the new moon of] the month, let him fast it; and whoever is ill or on a journey - then an equal number of other days. Allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship." (Quran 2:185)

### Hadith on Ramadan

The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said:

> "When the month of Ramadan starts, the gates of the heaven are opened and the gates of Hell are closed and the devils are chained." (Sahih Bukhari)

> "Whoever fasts Ramadan out of faith and seeking reward, his previous sins will be forgiven." (Sahih Bukhari)

> "Fasting is a shield with which a person protects himself from Hell." (Ahmad)

> "Paradise has eight gates, and one of them is called Ar-Rayyan through which none will enter but those who observe fasting." (Sahih Bukhari)

### Virtues of Ramadan
