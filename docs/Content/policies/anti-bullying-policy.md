## Definition of Bullying

Bullying is **unwanted, aggressive behavior** that involves a real or perceived power imbalance. The behavior is repeated, or has the potential to be repeated, over time.

### Three Key Elements

**3. Repetition**
- Happens more than once
- Or has strong potential to be repeated

### What Bullying is NOT

- **Conflict** between equals (different issue, needs conflict resolution)
- **Single acts** of aggression or meanness (still serious, but not bullying)
- **Friendly teasing** between equals (both enjoy it)
- **Normal childhood behaviors** like occasional arguments
