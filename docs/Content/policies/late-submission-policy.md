## Islamic Foundation

### Time as a Trust (Amanah)

> "And He is the one who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon; all [heavenly bodies] in an orbit are swimming." (Quran 21:33)

> "So patience is beautiful, and Allah is the sought for all His help." (Quran 12:18)

### The Value of Fulfilling Commitments

> "O you who have believed, fulfill [all] contracts." (Quran 5:1)

### Hadith on Time and Work

**The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said:**

> "Allah loves that when one of you does something, he does it perfectly." (Sunan al-Bayhaqi)

> "The strong person is not the one who can wrestle. The strong person is the one who controls himself when he is angry." (Sahih Bukhari) — This self-control extends to managing time and commitments.

### Islamic Work Ethic

**Islam teaches:**
- **Al-Qasd (Moderation)**: Balanced approach to time management
- **Al-Hilm (Patience)**: Working consistently without procrastination
- **Al-Mas'uliyyah (Responsibility)**: Being accountable for one's duties
