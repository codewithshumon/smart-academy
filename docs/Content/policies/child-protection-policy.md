### Hadith on Children

The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said:

> "Each of you is a shepherd and each of you is responsible for his flock." (Sahih Bukhari)

> "He is not one of us who does not show mercy to our young ones and respect our old ones." (Tirmidhi)

> "The parable of the believers in their affection, mercy, and sympathy for each other is like one body; when any part aches, the whole body reacts with sleeplessness and fever." (Sahih Muslim)
