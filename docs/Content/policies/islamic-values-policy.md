## Islamic Foundation

### Quranic Guidance

**On Character:**
> "Indeed, Allah enjoins justice and kindness and giving to relatives, and forbids immorality and bad conduct and oppression. He admonishes you that perhaps you will be reminded." (Quran 16:90)

**On Success:**
> "O you who have believed, obey Allah and His Messenger and do not turn from Him while you hear [His message]." (Quran 8:20)

### Hadith on Education and Character

The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said:

> "The best among you are those who have the best manners and character." (Sahih Bukhari)

> "Seeking knowledge is obligatory upon every Muslim." (Ibn Majah)

> "The most complete of believers in faith is the one with the best character." (Tirmidhi)

> "Verily, Allah has Excellence (Ihsan) for everything, so when you kill, kill in a good way, and when you slaughter, slaughter in a good way." (Sahih Muslim)
