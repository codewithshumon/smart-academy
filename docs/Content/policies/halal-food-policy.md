## Islamic Foundation

### Quranic Guidance on Halal and Haram

**Halal is Clear:**
> "O mankind, eat from whatever is on earth [that is] lawful and good and do not follow the footsteps of Satan. Indeed, he is to you a clear enemy." (Quran 2:168)

**Prohibition of Pork:**
> "He has only forbidden to you dead animals, blood, the flesh of swine, and that which has been dedicated to other than Allah." (Quran 2:173)

**Prohibition of Intoxicants:**
> "O you who have believed, indeed, intoxicants, gambling, [sacrificing on] stone alters [to other than Allah], and divining arrows are but defilement from the work of Satan, so avoid it that you may be successful." (Quran 5:90)

**Eat What is Halal and Good:**
> "So eat of what Allah has provided for you [which is] lawful and good. And be grateful for the favor of Allah, if it is Him that you worship." (Quran 16:114)

### Hadith on Halal Food

The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said:

> "The Halal is clear and the Haram is clear, and between them are matters unclear that are unknown to most people. Whoever avoids the unclear, protects his religion and honor." (Sahih Bukhari)

> "A man will travel on a long journey, disheveled and dust-stained, raising his hands to the sky, 'O Lord! O Lord!' But his food is Haram, his drink is Haram, his clothing is Haram. How can his supplication be answered?" (Sahih Muslim)

> "Allah is pure and accepts only that which is pure." (Sahih Muslim)
