## Islamic Perspective

### Mindful Technology Use

**Islamic Principles:**

**1. Wasting Time**
> "The son of Adam will not be freed from the presence of his Lord until he is asked about five things: his life and how he spent it..." (Tirmidhi)

Technology should not waste valuable time that could be used for beneficial pursuits.

**2. Protecting the Gaze**
> "Tell the believing men to lower their gaze." (Quran 24:30)

Devices should not be used to view inappropriate content.

**3. Good Speech**
> "And speak to people good words." (Quran 2:83)

Communication through devices should be kind and appropriate.

**4. Avoiding Suspicion**
> "And avoid much [negative] assumption." (Quran 49:12)

Excessive device use can create unnecessary suspicion and mistrust.

### Our Approach

**We Teach Students To:**
- Use technology for beneficial purposes
- Avoid harmful or wasteful use
- Maintain Islamic character online and offline
- Value face-to-face interaction
- Respect others through technology use
- Balance technology with other activities
