## Assessment Philosophy

### Islamic Perspective on Assessment

**Allah's Awareness:**

> "And He is with you wherever you are." (Quran 57:4)

> "And say, 'My Lord, increase me in knowledge.'" (Quran 20:114)

**The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said:**

> "Allah loves that when one of you does a job, he does it perfectly." (Tabarani)

### Our Assessment Beliefs

**1. Multiple Purposes**
Assessment serves learning, not just measures it. We assess to:
- Guide instruction
- Identify needs
- Monitor progress
- Celebrate success
- Report achievement

**2. Multiple Methods**
No single assessment can capture a student's full abilities. We use:
- Observations and conversations
- Products and performances
- Tests and quizzes
- Projects and presentations
- Self and peer assessments

**3. Fairness to All**
- Clear criteria established before assessment
- Various demonstration methods allowed
- Accommodations for documented needs
- Bias-free evaluation practices

**4. Growth Mindset**
- All students can improve
- Mistakes are learning opportunities
- Effort and progress valued
- Final judgment not made prematurely

**5. Whole Child Assessment**
- Academic skills and knowledge
- Islamic character and practice
- Social and emotional development
- Physical and creative abilities
