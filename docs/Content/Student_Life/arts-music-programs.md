## Philosophy of Arts Education

### Islamic Perspective on Arts

**Beautiful Creation**:
Allah (SWT) describes Himself as Al-Jameel (The Beautiful) and loves beauty:

> *"Allah is beautiful and loves beauty."* — Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)

**Art as Worship**:
When art is created with good intention (niyyah), it can be an act of worship:
- To appreciate Allah's beautiful creation
- To develop the talents Allah has given
- To create beauty that benefits others
- To express gratitude and praise

**Guidelines for Islamic Arts**:
- Avoid depiction of sentient beings (particularly in sacred spaces)
- Focus on calligraphy, geometric patterns, nature
- Ensure modesty in performance and visual representation
- Avoid music that contradicts Islamic values
- Use arts for positive, beneficial purposes

### Our Arts Philosophy

At Smart Academy, we believe arts education:
- **Develops creativity** given by Allah to all humans
- **Expresses faith** and Islamic identity
- **Builds confidence** and self-expression
- **Enhances learning** across all subjects
- **Prepares students** to appreciate beauty in Allah's creation
- **Provides balance** to academic pursuits
