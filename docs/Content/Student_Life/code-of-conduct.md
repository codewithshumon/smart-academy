## Introduction

### As-Salamu Alaikum, Dear Students

At Smart Academy, our Code of Conduct is not just a list of rules—it is a reflection of our Islamic values and our commitment to creating a safe, respectful, and nurturing environment where every student can thrive.

We believe in **positive discipline** that:
- Focuses on teaching, not just punishing
