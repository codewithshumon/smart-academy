## Our Philosophy of Student Life

### Core Principles

**1. Integration, Not Separation**
We don't separate "academic life" from "spiritual life" or "social life." Instead, we create an integrated experience where:
- Islamic values inform all activities
- Learning happens everywhere, not just in classrooms
- Character development is as important as academic achievement
- Every experience is an opportunity for growth

**2. Student Agency and Voice**
We believe students should be active participants, not passive recipients:
- Student Council represents student interests
- Feedback shapes programs and policies
- Leadership opportunities at every grade level
- Students initiate clubs and activities

**3. Community and Belonging**
Every student should feel they belong:
- Small class sizes (max 25 students) foster close relationships
- Buddy systems for new students
- Inclusive activities that welcome everyone
- Zero tolerance for bullying

**4. Balance and Moderation**
We teach and model Islamic moderation:
- Balance between academics and activities
- Balance between serious study and joyful play
- Balance between individual achievement and community service
- Balance between tradition and innovation
