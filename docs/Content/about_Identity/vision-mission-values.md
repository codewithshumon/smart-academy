## Introduction

At Smart Academy, our Vision, Mission, and Core Values are not mere words on paper - they are the living principles that guide every decision, shape every interaction, and inform every aspect of our educational practice.

These principles answer fundamental questions:
- **Vision**: What future do we seek to create?
- **Mission**: How do we create that future?
- **Values**: What principles guide us in our work?

Together, they provide a clear, consistent framework that ensures all stakeholders - students, parents, teachers, staff, and community - are unified in purpose and direction.
