## Pre-Foundation Era (Before 2020)

### The Vision Takes Shape (2017-2019)

**2017: The Seed is Planted**

The story of Smart Academy begins not in 2020, but years earlier in the hearts and minds of Smart Foundation's leadership. During a visit to rural Laxmipur district in 2017, Foundation board members witnessed firsthand the educational disparities plaguing rural Bangladesh:

- **Crumbling infrastructure**: Schools with leaking roofs, broken furniture, inadequate facilities
- **Unqualified teachers**: Many teaching without proper training or certification
- **Limited resources**: No computers, minimal books, outdated teaching materials
- **Low expectations**: Students and families accepting mediocrity as inevitable
- **Urban-rural divide**: Children in cities receiving vastly superior education

This eye-opening experience sparked a question: **"Why should a child's postal code determine their educational destiny?"**

**2018: Research & Planning Phase**

Smart Foundation commissioned a comprehensive study to:
- Assess educational needs in rural Laxmipur
- Survey community attitudes toward education
- Identify gaps in existing provisions
- Research best practices in rural education
- Develop feasibility analysis

**Key Findings**:
- High demand for quality education among families
- Willingness to invest in children's education despite limited means
- Lack of institutions combining Islamic and modern education
- Absence of English-medium options in region
- Technology deficit in all existing schools
- Shortage of qualified, trained teachers

**Decision**: The Foundation committed to establishing a model institution that would demonstrate that rural areas could host world-class educational facilities.

**2019: Detailed Planning**

Throughout 2019, intensive planning occurred:

**January-March: Site Selection**
- Evaluated 15 potential locations
- Criteria: Accessibility, land availability, community need, expansion potential
- Selected Narimpur, Ramganj based on central location and high need

**April-June: Curriculum Development**
- Assembled expert team of educators
- Designed integrated Islamic-modern curriculum
- Adopted STEAM education framework
- Developed grade-by-grade learning outcomes
- Created assessment systems

**July-September: Infrastructure Planning**
- Engaged architects to design campus
- Planned smart classrooms with technology integration
- Designed age-appropriate learning spaces
- Ensured Islamic architectural elements
- Prioritized safety and accessibility

**October-December: Recruitment & Preparation**
- Advertised teacher positions nationally
- Conducted rigorous recruitment process
- Selected 15 founding teachers
- Provided intensive pre-service training
- Developed operational policies and procedures

**December 2019: Name Selection**

After considerable deliberation, "Smart Academy" was chosen to reflect:
- Connection to Smart Foundation
- Technology integration ("Smart" classrooms)
- Intelligence development focus
- Modern, forward-looking identity

**Tagline adopted**: "Transforming Minds, Illuminating Futures"
