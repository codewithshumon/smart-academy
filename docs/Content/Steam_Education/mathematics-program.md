## Introduction to Mathematics in STEAM

### Mathematics: The Language of the Universe

Mathematics is not merely a subject—it is the language through which we understand patterns in Allah's creation, solve real-world problems, and unlock the mysteries of science, technology, engineering, and art. At Smart Academy, mathematics is the foundation upon which all STEAM learning is built.

**Mathematics pervades all aspects of STEAM:**

**Science:** Measurement, data analysis, graphing, calculations, modeling natural phenomena

**Technology:** Algorithms, coding logic, digital systems, computational thinking

**Engineering:** Measurements, ratios, geometry, structural calculations, design optimization

**Arts:** Proportion, perspective, geometric patterns, musical ratios, symmetry

### Why Mathematics Matters

**Cognitive Development:**
- Develops logical reasoning and analytical thinking
- Builds problem-solving skills applicable across all domains
- Enhances spatial reasoning and visual-spatial intelligence
- Strengthens memory and pattern recognition

**Real-World Application:**
- Essential for everyday life (financial literacy, measurement, data interpretation)
- Foundation for STEM careers
- Critical for informed citizenship (understanding statistics, data, probability)
- Universal language transcending cultural boundaries

**Islamic Perspective:**
- Mathematics reveals the order and precision in Allah's creation
- Many verses in the Quran reference numbers, measurements, and mathematical concepts

### Smart Academy's Approach to Mathematics

Our mathematics program is distinctive in several key ways:

**1. Conceptual Understanding Before Procedures:**
Students understand why mathematical processes work, not just how to execute them. This deep understanding enables flexible problem-solving and application to novel situations.

**2. Real-World and Islamic Integration:**
Mathematics is never abstract or disconnected. Every concept is connected to real-world applications and, where appropriate, Islamic practices and heritage.

**3. Problem-Solving Emphasis:**
Rather than focusing solely on computation, we emphasize mathematical reasoning, multiple solution strategies, and applying mathematics to authentic problems.

**4. Technology as a Tool:**
Students use technology (calculators, software, apps) as tools to explore mathematics more deeply, not as replacements for understanding.

**5. Growth Mindset Culture:**
Mathematics ability is not fixed—every student can excel in mathematics through effort, practice, and effective strategies. Mistakes are celebrated as learning opportunities.

**6. Differentiation and Challenge:**
Instruction meets students at their current level while providing appropriate challenge. Advanced students have opportunities for enrichment and competition, while struggling students receive targeted support.

**7. Communication and Collaboration:**
Mathematics is a social endeavor. Students explain their thinking, critique reasoning, and work collaboratively on problems.

## Vision and Philosophy

### Vision Statement

"To develop confident, creative mathematical thinkers who use the language of mathematics to understand Allah's creation, solve real-world problems, and contribute positively to society."

### Philosophy of Mathematics Education

**Every Student Can Excel:**
We reject the notion that some people are "just not math people." With effective instruction, effort, and growth mindset, every student can achieve mathematical proficiency.

**Understanding Over Memorization:**
While fluency is important, it must be built on conceptual understanding. Students who understand why can flexibly apply knowledge; those who merely memorize are limited to familiar problems.

**Mistakes Are Valuable:**
Errors provide insight into student thinking and offer opportunities for learning. We create safe environments where students take intellectual risks without fear of judgment.

**Multiple Representations:**
Mathematical concepts are explored through multiple representations:
- Concrete (manipulatives, physical models)
- Pictorial (drawings, diagrams, graphs)
- Abstract (symbols, equations, algorithms)
- Verbal (explanations, discussions, word problems)

**Problem-Solving Is Central:**
Mathematics is fundamentally about solving problems. Computation and procedures are tools in service of problem-solving, not ends in themselves.

**Mathematical Practices Matter:**
Beyond content, students develop mathematical habits of mind:
- Making sense of problems and persevering
- Reasoning abstractly and quantitatively
- Constructing viable arguments and critiquing reasoning
- Modeling with mathematics
- Using appropriate tools strategically
- Attending to precision
- Looking for and making use of structure
- Looking for and expressing regularity in repeated reasoning

**Islamic Integration:**
Mathematics education honors Islamic heritage, applies Islamic contexts, and recognizes mathematics as a means to understand Allah's perfect creation.

## Islamic Applications of Mathematics

Mathematics in Islam is not merely a secular subject—it is deeply intertwined with religious practice, ethical principles, and a rich scholarly heritage.

### Zakat Calculations

Zakat (obligatory charity) is the third pillar of Islam and requires precise mathematical calculation.

**Nisab:**
Minimum wealth threshold requiring Zakat. Based on value of gold (87.48g) or silver (612.36g).

**Current Nisab** (example, changes with gold/silver prices):
- Gold Nisab: 87.48g × current gold price
- Silver Nisab: 612.36g × current silver price
- Use lower value (usually silver) for maximum benefit to recipients

**Zakat Rate: 2.5%**
- As decimal: 0.025
- As fraction: 1/40

**Types of Wealth Subject to Zakat:**

**1. Cash and Savings:**
Zakat = Total × 0.025

Example: 200,000 Taka in savings (above Nisab)
Zakat = 200,000 × 0.025 = 5,000 Taka

**2. Gold and Silver:**
Zakat on gold/silver owned (if above Nisab)

Example: Own 100g of gold (above 87.48g Nisab)
If gold price is 7,000 Taka/g
Value = 100 × 7,000 = 700,000 Taka
Zakat = 700,000 × 0.025 = 17,500 Taka

**3. Business Goods and Assets:**
Zakat on business inventory and liquid assets

**4. Agricultural Produce:**
Different rates:
- 10% if rain-fed (no irrigation costs)
- 5% if irrigated (recognizing irrigation expenses)

**Class Activities:**

**Primary (Class 4-5):**
- Understanding 2.5% as fraction (1/40) and decimal (0.025)
- Simple Zakat calculations
- Understanding Nisab concept
- Discussing importance of accuracy

**Secondary (Class 6-9):**
- Complex Zakat calculations (multiple assets)
- Nisab calculations based on current gold/silver prices
- Agricultural Zakat with different rates
- Business Zakat (inventory valuation)
- Creating Zakat calculators

**Sample Problem (Class 7):**

Ahmed's family has the following assets:
- Savings: 150,000 Taka
- Gold: 50g (gold price: 7,000 Taka/g)
- Business inventory: 80,000 Taka value

Calculate Zakat due.

**Solution:**
Total zakatable wealth:
- Cash: 150,000
- Gold: 50g × 7,000 = 350,000
- Business: 80,000
- **Total: 580,000 Taka**

Zakat: 580,000 × 0.025 = **14,500 Taka**

**Discussion:**
- Importance of mathematical accuracy in religious obligation
- How Zakat helps redistribute wealth
- Blessing of giving and purification of wealth

### Islamic Inheritance (Fara'id)

Islamic inheritance law is mathematically precise, ensuring just distribution according to Quranic directives.

**Note:** Full Fara'id is complex; we teach simplified introductory concepts.

**Basic Shares (Quranic):**

**Husband:**
- 1/2 if deceased wife has no children
- 1/4 if deceased wife has children

**Wife:**
- 1/4 if deceased husband has no children
- 1/8 if deceased husband has children

**Father:**
- 1/6 if deceased has children
- Plus residuary if sons, or all residuary if no children

**Mother:**
- 1/3 if no children and no siblings of deceased
- 1/6 if deceased has children or siblings

**Daughter(s):**
- 1 daughter: 1/2 if no sons
- 2+ daughters: 2/3 if no sons
- With son(s): Residuary shared (son gets 2x daughter's share)

**Son(s):**
- Residuary (after fixed shares distributed)
- Sons and daughters share 2:1 ratio

**Siblings, Grandparents, etc.:**
- Various shares depending on circumstances

**Mathematical Process:**

**Step 1: Identify heirs and their shares**

**Step 2: Find common denominator**
Example shares: 1/2, 1/4, 1/6
Common denominator: 12

**Step 3: Calculate shares**
Convert fractions to common denominator:
- 1/2 = 6/12
- 1/4 = 3/12
- 1/6 = 2/12

**Step 4: Calculate monetary value**
If estate = 120,000 Taka:
- 6/12 = 60,000
- 3/12 = 30,000
- 2/12 = 20,000

**Sample Problem (Class 8):**

A person passes away leaving:
- Estate: 240,000 Taka
- Heirs: Wife, 2 daughters, 1 son

Calculate each heir's share.

**Solution:**

**Wife's share:** 1/8 (because there are children)
- 240,000 × 1/8 = 30,000 Taka

**Remaining for children:** 240,000 - 30,000 = 210,000 Taka

**Children's shares (2 daughters, 1 son):**
Ratio 1:1:2 (daughter:daughter:son)
Total parts: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4

- Each daughter: 210,000 × 1/4 = 52,500 Taka
- Son: 210,000 × 2/4 = 105,000 Taka

**Verification:**
30,000 + 52,500 + 52,500 + 105,000 = 240,000 ✓

**Discussion:**
- Islamic justice in inheritance
- Why son receives more (traditional financial responsibility for family)
- Precision and fairness in Islamic law
- Mathematics ensuring exact implementation of Quranic directives

### Prayer Time Calculations

Prayer times are based on sun's position, requiring astronomy and trigonometry.

**Five Daily Prayers and Their Times:**

**1. Fajr (Dawn Prayer):**
- Begins: When sun is 18° below horizon (astronomical dawn)
- Ends: Just before sunrise

**2. Dhuhr (Noon Prayer):**
- Begins: Just after sun crosses meridian (true noon)
- Ends: When shadow of object = object length + noon shadow

**3. Asr (Afternoon Prayer):**
- Begins: When shadow = object length + noon shadow
- Ends: Just before sunset

**4. Maghrib (Sunset Prayer):**
- Begins: Just after sunset
- Ends: When twilight disappears

**5. Isha (Night Prayer):**
- Begins: When sun is 18° below horizon (astronomical twilight ends)
- Ends: Before midnight or Fajr

**Mathematical Calculations:**

Prayer times require:
- **Latitude and longitude** of location
- **Solar declination** (varies with date)
- **Equation of time** (correction for Earth's elliptical orbit)
- **Trigonometric functions**

**Example Calculation (Simplified for Class 8-9):**

**Calculating True Noon (for Dhuhr time):**

True noon = 12:00 + Equation of Time - (Longitude difference from standard meridian / 15)

**For Dhaka, Bangladesh:**
- Longitude: 90.4° E
- Standard meridian for Bangladesh time: 90° E
- Difference: 0.4°

True noon = 12:00 + EoT - (0.4/15 minutes)
True noon ≈ 12:00 + EoT - 1.6 minutes

**Equation of Time** varies throughout year (-16 to +16 minutes)

**Class Activities:**

**Class 6-7:**
- Understanding sun's path across sky
- Observing shadow lengths at different times
- Using prayer time tables and understanding variations
- Graphing prayer times throughout the year

**Integration:**
- **Science:** Astronomy, Earth's rotation and orbit
- **Mathematics:** Trigonometry, graphing, patterns
- **Islamic Studies:** Importance of timely prayer
- **Geography:** How prayer times vary by location

### Qibla Direction

Determining Qibla (direction to Kaaba in Makkah) from any location requires spherical geometry.

**Simplified Approach (Class 6-7):**

Using maps and compass directions:
- Identify location on world map
- Identify Makkah location
- Determine general direction
- Adjust for map projection distortions

**Mathematical Approach (Class 8-9):**

**Spherical Geometry Formula:**

```
Qibla = arctan [ sin(ΔLong) / (cos(Lat1) × tan(Lat2) - sin(Lat1) × cos(ΔLong)) ]

Where:
- Lat1 = Your latitude
- Lat2 = Makkah's latitude (21.4225° N)
- Long1 = Your longitude
- Long2 = Makkah's longitude (39.8262° E)
- ΔLong = Long2 - Long1

**Training Approach:**

**Introduce Problem Type:**
Teacher presents problem category and fundamental concepts.

**Example Problems:**
Work through example problems together, emphasizing solution strategies.

**Student Practice:**
Students attempt similar problems independently or in small groups.

**Sharing Solutions:**
Students present solutions, discuss approaches, learn from each other.

**Challenge Problems:**
More difficult problems for independent work.

**Mock Competitions:**
Timed practice tests simulating competition conditions.

**Sample Training Session: "Pigeonhole Principle"**

**Introduction (15 min):**
"If you have n+1 pigeons and n pigeonholes, at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon."

Simple example: 13 students born in 12 months → at least 2 students share a birth month.

**Example Problems (30 min):**

**Problem 1:** Show that among 5 points in a square with side length 2, at least two are within distance √2 of each other.

**Solution:** Divide square into 4 unit squares (quadrants). 5 points, 4 squares → at least one square contains 2 points. Farthest apart in unit square = diagonal = √2. ∴ At least 2 points within √2.

**Problem 2:** Prove that in any set of 7 distinct integers, there exist two whose sum or difference is divisible by 10.

**Solution:** Consider remainders when divided by 10 (0-9). Pair them: (0), (1,9), (2,8), (3,7), (4,6), (5). That's 6 categories. 7 integers, 6 categories → at least two in same category. If both remainder 0, difference divisible by 10. If paired (e.g., 1 and 9), sum = 10, divisible by 10. ∎

**Student Practice (40 min):**
Work on similar problems, increasing difficulty.
