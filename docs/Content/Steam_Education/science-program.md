In Islam, the study of science is an act of worship (ibadah) and reflection (tadabbur). The Quran repeatedly encourages believers to observe, reflect upon, and understand the natural world as signs (ayat) of Allah's wisdom and power.

**Quranic Foundation**

The Quran contains numerous verses encouraging scientific inquiry:

> "Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the night and day are signs for those of understanding." (Quran 3:190)

> "Say, 'Travel through the earth and observe how He began creation.'" (Quran 29:20)

> "And He has subjected to you whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth - all from Him. Indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought." (Quran 45:13)

> "We will show them Our signs in the horizons and within themselves until it becomes clear to them that it is the truth." (Quran 41:53)
