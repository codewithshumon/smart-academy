## Technology Education Philosophy

### Our Approach to Technology Education

**Technology as a Tool, Not a Goal**

Technology is a powerful tool for learning, creating, and communicating. We focus on using technology purposefully to achieve educational goals, not using technology for its own sake.

**Principles:**
- Technology enhances learning when used appropriately
- Traditional skills (writing, reading, math) remain fundamental
- Balance between screen time and other activities
- Critical evaluation of when and how to use technology
- Technology serves human purposes, guided by values

**Developmentally Appropriate Technology Use**

Technology instruction and access are tailored to developmental stages:
- **Early Childhood:** Limited, guided exposure; emphasis on creativity and exploration
- **Primary:** Building foundational skills; supervised use; balance with hands-on activities
- **Secondary:** Independent use; advanced skills; responsible self-management

**Active Creation Over Passive Consumption**

Students learn to be creators and producers of technology, not just consumers:
- Creating content (writing, designing, coding, recording)
- Solving problems with technology
