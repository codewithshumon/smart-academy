## Islamic Perspective on Science

### Quranic Foundation

The Quran repeatedly encourages believers to observe, reflect upon, and study the natural world as signs (Ayat) of Allah's power and wisdom.

**Key Quranic Verses**

1. **Observation and Reflection**
   > "Say, 'Observe what is in the heavens and earth.'" (Quran 10:101)

2. **Signs in Creation**
   > "And He has subjected to you whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth - all from Him. Indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought." (Quran 45:13)

3. **Water Cycle**
   > "And We have sent down rain from the sky in a measured amount and settled it in the earth. And indeed, We are Able to take it away." (Quran 23:18)

4. **Embryology**
   > "And certainly did We create man from an extract of clay. Then We placed him as a sperm-drop in a firm lodging. Then We made the sperm-drop into a clinging clot, and We made the clot into a lump [of flesh], and We made [from] the lump, bones, and We covered the bones with flesh; then We developed him into another creation. So blessed is Allah, the best of creators." (Quran 23:12-14)

5. **Expansion of Universe**
   > "And the heaven We constructed with strength, and indeed, We are [its] expander." (Quran 51:47)

6. **Fingerprints**
   > "Does man think that We will not assemble his bones? Yes. [We are] Able [even] to proportion his fingertips." (Quran 75:3-4)

7. **Mountains as Pegs**
   > "Have We not made the earth a resting place? And the mountains as stakes?" (Quran 78:6-7)

8. **Iron from Space**
   > "And We sent down iron, wherein is great military might and benefits for the people." (Quran 57:25)

### Hadith on Knowledge

**Prophetic Encouragement**

1. "Seeking knowledge is an obligation upon every Muslim." (Ibn Majah)

2. "Whoever follows a path in the pursuit of knowledge, Allah will make easy for him a path to Paradise." (Muslim)

3. "The superiority of the scholar over the worshipper is like the superiority of the moon over the stars." (Abu Dawud)
