## Philosophy and Approach

### Our Mathematical Philosophy

> "He is the Knower of the unseen and the witnessed, the Grand, the Exalted. He knows what is within the heavens and earth. Indeed, He is Knowing of that within the breasts. It is He who made you successors upon the earth. And whoever disbelieves—upon him will be [the consequence of] his disbelief." - Quran 35:38-39

Mathematics reveals the order, precision, and beauty of Allah's creation. Our philosophy rests on several core beliefs:

### Quranic Verses Related to Mathematics

**Counting and Number**
> "Allah knows what every female carries and what the wombs lose [prematurely] or exceed. And everything with Him is by due measure." - Quran 13:8

> "And the sun runs [on course] toward its stopping point. That is the determination of the Exalted in Might, the Knowing. And the moon—We have determined for it phases, until it returns [appearing] like the old date stalk. It is not allowable for the sun to reach the moon, nor does the night overtake the day, but each, in an orbit, is swimming." - Quran 36:38-40

**Measurement and Calculation**
> "The sun and the moon [move] by precise calculation." - Quran 55:5

> "And [mention] the Day when We will fold the heaven like the folding of a [written] sheet for the records. As We began the first creation, We will repeat it. [That is] a promise binding upon Us. Indeed, We will do it." - Quran 21:104

**Balance and Proportion**
> "And the heaven He raised and imposed the balance. That you not transgress within the balance. And establish weight in justice and do not make deficient the balance." - Quran 55:7-9

**Wisdom in Creation**
> "Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day are signs for those of understanding." - Quran 3:190
