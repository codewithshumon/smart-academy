## Assessment & Testing

### About Assessments

**Q: Does every applicant need to take an assessment?**

**Q: How should I prepare my child for the assessment?**
A: No special preparation is needed. Ensure your child is well-rested, has eaten properly, and arrives on time. Over-preparation causes unnecessary stress.

A: We don't provide sample questions. The assessment evaluates natural ability and readiness, not prepared knowledge.

A: This is normal. Reassure your child that it's not a pass-fail test but an opportunity for teachers to understand how to help them learn.

A: For PlayGroup-KG, parents may stay briefly for settling in. For older students, parents wait in a designated area and return for their interview.

**Q: Is there an interview?**
A: Yes, both student and parent interviews are part of the process. These help us understand the family and ensure mutual understanding of Smart Academy's approach.

**Q: How long does the assessment take?**
A: Duration varies by grade: PlayGroup-KG (30-45 min), Class 1-3 (1-2 hours), Class 4-5 (2-3 hours), Class 6-9 (3-4 hours).

**Q: When are assessment results shared?**
A: Individual results are not shared. Final admission decisions incorporating all factors are communicated by March 15.
