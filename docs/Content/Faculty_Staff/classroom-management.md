## Overview

Effective classroom management creates an environment where learning can flourish. At Smart Academy, we approach classroom management from an Islamic perspective—building character, teaching responsibility, and treating students with the dignity they deserve as creations of Allah.

## Islamic Foundation of Classroom Management

### Prophetic Model

**The Prophet's (peace be upon him) Approach:**
- Kindness and gentleness in teaching
- Patience with learners
- Encouragement rather than harsh criticism
- Leading by example
- Making learning engaging and relevant

**Quranic Guidance:**
- "Speak to him gently and kindly" (Quran 20:44)
- "Repel [evil] with [good] is better" (Quran 41:34)
- "Allah loves those who are constant in repentance" (Quran 2:222)
- "And speak good to people" (Quran 2:83)

### Character Development Focus

**Islamic Character (Akhlaq) in Management:**
- Patience (Sabr): With challenging behaviors
- Kindness (Rahma): In correction and guidance
- Justice (Adl): Fair and equal treatment
- Forgiveness (Afu): Moving past mistakes
- Wisdom (Hikmah): Knowing best approach for each student
- Mercy (Rahmah): Understanding student struggles

**Character Over Compliance:**
- Goal is character development, not just obedience
- Teach students WHY, not just WHAT
- Develop self-discipline, not external control
- Focus on internal motivation, not just rewards
