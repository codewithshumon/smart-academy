## Assessment Strategies

### Questioning Techniques

**Effective Questions:**
- Open-ended questions (more than yes/no)
- Wait time (3-5 seconds after asking)
- Follow-up questions ("Why?" "How do you know?")
- Multiple right answers
- Require thinking, not just recall

**Questioning for Understanding:**
- "Can you explain that in your own words?"
- "How would you apply this to a new situation?"
- "What would happen if...?"
- "How is this similar to/different from...?"
- "Can you give an example?"

### Feedback Practices

**Effective Feedback:**
- **Timely:** Given soon after assessment
- **Specific:** Identifies strengths and areas for improvement
- **Actionable:** Tells student what to do next
- **Balanced:** Includes positive and constructive
- **Understandable:** Student can understand and use it

**Feedback Examples:**

**Instead of:** "Good job"
**Try:** "You correctly identified the main idea. Next, work on providing more supporting details."

**Instead of:** "Try harder"
**Try:** "You have the right approach. Check your calculations in step 3."

**Instead of:** "Redo this"
**Try:** "Your introduction is clear. Develop your examples in the body paragraphs."

### Student Self-Assessment

**Building Self-Assessment Skills:**
- Model how to assess work
- Provide clear criteria and rubrics
- Teach students to give themselves feedback
- Use reflection prompts
- Set personal learning goals

**Self-Assessment Prompts:**
- "What did I do well?"
- "What do I need to improve?"
- "What strategy helped me learn this?"
- "What will I do differently next time?"
- "What am I still confused about?"

### Portfolio Assessment

**Purpose:**
- Show growth over time
- Collect best work
- Demonstrate achievement
- Reflect on learning

**What to Include:**
- Selected work samples
- Student reflections
- Teacher feedback
- Multiple drafts showing improvement
