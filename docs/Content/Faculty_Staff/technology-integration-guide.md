## Overview

Technology, when used purposefully, can enhance teaching and learning at Smart Academy. This guide provides frameworks, strategies, and Islamic guidelines for integrating technology effectively while maintaining our commitment to Islamic values and character development.

## Philosophy of Technology Integration

### Purposeful Integration

**Technology as Tool, Not Driver:**
- Technology serves learning objectives, not vice versa
- Used when it adds value to lesson
- Enhances, does not replace, teacher-student interaction
- Balanced with non-technology methods

### Islamic Perspective

**Responsible Use:**
- Technology is amanah (trust) - use responsibly
- Avoid haram content and activities
- Balance online and offline life
- Use skills for benefit of Ummah
- Protect eyes and time from misuse

**Key Principles:**
- Intention (Niyyah): Use technology for beneficial purposes
- Modesty: Appropriate content and interactions
- Time management: Avoid excessive screen time
- Truthfulness: Honest use of information and sources
- Social responsibility: Use for good, not harm

## TPACK Framework

### Understanding Technology Integration

**TPACK: Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge**

**Three Types of Knowledge:**

**1. Content Knowledge (CK):**
- What you teach (subject matter)

**2. Pedagogical Knowledge (PK):**
- How you teach (teaching methods)

**3. Technological Knowledge (TK):**
- Technology tools and their use

**Effective Integration:**
- Combines all three types
- Technology chosen based on content and pedagogy
- Not using technology just for novelty
- Strategic and purposeful selection

**Example:**
- **Content:** Teaching photosynthesis (Science)
- **Pedagogy:** Visual demonstration and hands-on exploration
- **Technology:** Video showing process, simulation for manipulation
- **Integration:** Technology helps students SEE and UNDERSTAND what can't be observed directly

## Pedagogical Approaches

### SAMR Model

**Levels of Technology Integration:**

**Substitution:**
- Tech acts as direct substitute with no functional change
- Example: Digital worksheet instead of paper worksheet
- **Lowest level of integration**

**Augmentation:**
- Tech acts as direct substitute with functional improvement
- Example: Typing with spell-check instead of handwriting
- **Some improvement**

**Modification:**
- Tech allows for significant task redesign
- Example: Collaborative document with real-time editing
- **Beginning to transform learning**

**Redefinition:**
- Tech allows for creation of previously inconceivable tasks
- Example: Connecting with students globally for project
- **Transformative learning**

**Goal:** Move toward modification and redefinition when appropriate

### Blended Learning

**Combining Online and Offline:**

**Station Rotation:**
- Students rotate through stations
- Some stations use technology, some don't
- Teacher works with small group at one station

**Flipped Classroom:**
- Students access content at home (video, reading)
- Class time used for practice, discussion, application
- Requires home access and parent support

**Project-Based Learning with Technology:**
- Students use technology for research and creation
- Collaborative tools for group work
- Present final product using technology

**Considerations for Smart Academy:**
- Not all students have home internet access
