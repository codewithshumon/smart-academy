# Primary Assessment System

**Smart Academy | Measuring Growth, Guiding Excellence**

---

## Assessment Philosophy

> **"Assessment is not about sorting students but about understanding their learning, celebrating their growth, and guiding them toward excellence."**

At Smart Academy, assessment is an integral part of the teaching and learning process, not a separate activity. We use assessment to understand what students know, identify what they need to learn, guide instructional decisions, communicate with parents, and help students take ownership of their learning. Our assessment system is comprehensive, balanced, fair, and aligned with Islamic values of justice, truthfulness, and continuous improvement.

**Core Principles:**
1. **Assessment FOR Learning** - Formative assessment guides instruction
2. **Assessment OF Learning** - Summative assessment measures achievement
3. **Assessment AS Learning** - Students reflect and self-assess
4. **Multiple Measures** - Diverse assessment methods
5. **Alignment** - Assessments align with curriculum and standards
6. **Fairness and Equity** - All students have opportunities to demonstrate learning
7. **Growth Mindset** - Focus on progress and effort, not just results
8. **Islamic Values** - Honesty, fairness, compassion in assessment
