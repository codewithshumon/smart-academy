# Primary Science Curriculum

**Smart Academy | Exploring Allah's Creation Through Scientific Inquiry**

---

## Science Philosophy

> **"In the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of night and day are signs for people of understanding." (Quran 3:190)**

Science education at Smart Academy is grounded in the belief that studying the natural world deepens our understanding and appreciation of Allah's creation. Through scientific inquiry, students develop curiosity, critical thinking, and a sense of wonder while recognizing that all knowledge ultimately leads back to the Creator.

**Core Principles:**
1. **Inquiry-Based Learning** - Students learn science by doing science
2. **Islamic Integration** - Science as a means to know Allah's wisdom
3. **Hands-On Investigation** - Direct experience with phenomena
4. **STEAM Integration** - Connecting science to technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics
5. **Critical Thinking** - Analyzing evidence and drawing conclusions
6. **Environmental Stewardship** - Caring for Allah's creation as a trust (Amanah)
