# Primary Technology Integration

**Smart Academy | Preparing Digital Citizens for the 21st Century**

---

## Technology Integration Philosophy

> **"In the modern world, technological literacy is as essential as reading and writing. We integrate technology not for its own sake, but as a powerful tool for learning, creativity, communication, and positive impact, all guided by Islamic values."**

Technology integration at Smart Academy is comprehensive, intentional, and values-based. We prepare students to be not just consumers of technology but creators, critical thinkers, and responsible digital citizens who use technology ethically and productively while maintaining Islamic principles.

**Core Principles:**
1. **Integrated, Not Separate** - Technology embedded across all subjects
2. **Islamic Values First** - Digital citizenship grounded in Islamic ethics
3. **Creation Over Consumption** - Students as creators, not just users
4. **Critical Digital Literacy** - Evaluating and using information wisely
5. **Safe and Responsible** - Online safety and digital wellness
6. **STEAM Enhancement** - Technology supporting Science, Math, Arts, Engineering
7. **Accessibility and Equity** - Technology access for all students

## Technology Integration Framework

### The SAMR Model

We use the SAMR model to guide technology integration:

**Substitution** - Technology substitutes traditional tools (e.g., typing instead of handwriting)
**Augmentation** - Technology enhances traditional tasks (e.g., spell-check in word processor)
**Modification** - Technology significantly redesigns tasks (e.g., collaborative online documents)
**Redefinition** - Technology enables previously impossible tasks (e.g., connecting with experts globally)

We aim for Modification and Redefinition levels while recognizing value of all levels.

### Technology Standards

Students develop proficiency in:
1. **Digital Citizenship** - Responsible, ethical, safe technology use
2. **Knowledge Constructor** - Researching, evaluating, synthesizing information
3. **Creative Communicator** - Creating and communicating with digital tools
4. **Innovative Designer** - Solving problems through design thinking
5. **Computational Thinker** - Developing algorithmic thinking and coding
6. **Global Collaborator** - Collaborating and learning with others globally
