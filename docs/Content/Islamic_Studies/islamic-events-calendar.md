## 1. Overview

The Islamic Events Calendar at Smart Academy integrates the Hijri (Islamic) calendar with the academic year, ensuring students understand and celebrate significant Islamic events while maintaining academic excellence. This comprehensive calendar system guides the planning of school activities, holidays, and special programs that honor Islamic traditions and foster spiritual growth.

> "Indeed, the number of months with Allah is twelve [lunar] months in the register of Allah [from] the day He created the heavens and the earth; of these, four are sacred." - Quran 9:36

The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:

> "The best of fasting after Ramadan is fasting Allah's month of Muharram, and the best of prayer after the obligatory prayer is the night prayer." - Sahih Muslim, Book 6, Hadith 2611

A: For major events like Eid, school is closed. For other events, the schedule is adjusted with special activities, assemblies, and educational programs. Half-days are common for significant Islamic events.

**Q: Are non-Muslim students required to participate in Islamic events?**

A: While Islamic events are designed for Muslim students, all students are welcome to participate in the educational and cultural aspects. Non-Muslim students may observe and learn about Islamic traditions without religious obligation.

### 10.2 Event-Specific Questions

**Q: How is Eid al-Fitr celebrated at school?**

A: Eid al-Fitr is celebrated with a special Eid prayer, festive activities, awards ceremony recognizing Ramadan achievements, community gathering with food and entertainment, and family participation.

**Q: What is the difference between Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha?**

A: The school prepares by adjusting the daily schedule, distributing Ramadan guides and calendars, decorating the school, organizing special activities, and conducting parent workshops on Ramadan preparation.

### 10.3 Calendar-Specific Questions

**Q: Why does the Islamic calendar change dates every year?**

A: The Islamic calendar is lunar-based with approximately 354 days per year, which is about 11 days shorter than the solar Gregorian calendar. This causes Islamic events to occur about 11 days earlier each year in the Gregorian calendar.
