## 1. Overview

The Akhlaq (Islamic Character) program at Smart Academy is designed to develop Islamic character and moral values in students, enabling them to embody the teachings of Islam in their daily lives. Akhlaq encompasses the cultivation of virtues, manners, and ethical behavior based on the Quran and Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). Our program guides students from basic understanding of Islamic values to comprehensive character development, preparing them to become righteous individuals who contribute positively to society.

### 1.1 Philosophy

The Akhlaq program is founded on these fundamental principles:

- **Prophetic Model**: Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is the perfect role model for Islamic character. Allah (SWT) states in Quran 33:21: "There has certainly been for you in the Messenger of Allah an excellent pattern."

- **Inner and Outer Character**: Islamic character encompasses both inner qualities (intentions, thoughts) and outer behavior (actions, speech). The Prophet (PBUH) said: "Allah does not look at your appearance or wealth, but rather He looks at your hearts and your deeds." (Sahih Muslim, Book 32, Hadith 6221)

- **Character as Worship**: Developing good character is an act of worship. The Prophet (PBUH) said: "The most complete of believers in faith is the one with best character." (At-Tirmidhi, Book 1, Hadith 1162)

- **Practical Application**: Character development is not merely theoretical; it must be demonstrated in daily actions and interactions.

- **Lifelong Journey**: Character development is a continuous process that extends throughout one's life.

### 1.2 Goals

The Akhlaq program aims to achieve the following goals:

1. **Character Development**: Enable students to develop Islamic character traits at an appropriate level for their age and development.

2. **Moral Values**: Teach students Islamic moral values and their practical application.

3. **Etiquette (Adab)**: Guide students to learn Islamic etiquette in all aspects of life.

4. **Social Skills**: Help students develop positive social skills based on Islamic principles.

5. **Self-Reflection**: Encourage students to reflect on their character and strive for improvement.

6. **Positive Influence**: Prepare students to be positive influences in their communities.

7. **Teaching Capability**: Prepare students to teach Islamic character to others.

8. **Integration**: Connect Akhlaq with Quran, Sunnah, and other Islamic studies.
