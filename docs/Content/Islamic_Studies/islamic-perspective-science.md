## 1. Overview

This document outlines Smart Academy's approach to integrating Islamic perspectives into science education. The integration is grounded in the belief that science is the study of Allah's creation (Ayat) and that understanding the natural world strengthens faith in the Creator. Through the Re-STEAM framework (Religion + STEAM), students learn to see scientific discoveries as manifestations of Allah's wisdom and power.

### 1.1 Philosophy

The Islamic philosophy of science education at Smart Academy is based on several fundamental principles:

- **Tawhid (Oneness of Allah)**: All scientific knowledge points to the unity and oneness of Allah. The laws of nature reflect Allah's consistent and systematic design.
- **Ayat (Signs of Allah)**: Scientific phenomena are signs (Ayat) that invite reflection and strengthen faith.
- **Khalifah (Stewardship)**: Humans are entrusted as caretakers of Allah's creation, responsible for its preservation and sustainable use.
- **Ilm (Knowledge)**: Seeking knowledge is a religious obligation, and scientific inquiry is a form of worship when done with right intention (Niyyah).
- **Balance**: Science education balances understanding of the physical world with spiritual awareness and ethical responsibility.

### 1.2 Goals

The integration of Islamic perspectives in science education aims to achieve the following goals:

**Knowledge Goals:**
- Understand scientific concepts as manifestations of Allah's creative power
- Learn about contributions of Muslim scientists throughout history
- Recognize Quranic verses that align with scientific discoveries
- Develop awareness of environmental stewardship from an Islamic perspective

**Skills Goals:**
- Apply critical thinking to explore the relationship between faith and science
- Conduct scientific inquiry with ethical considerations
- Analyze scientific findings through an Islamic worldview
- Develop research skills grounded in Islamic ethics

**Character Goals:**

## 2. Integration Philosophy

### 2.1 Islamic Foundations

The integration of Islamic perspectives in science education is founded on authentic Islamic sources:

**Quranic Foundations:**

> "Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day are signs for those of understanding."
> — Quran 3:190

> "And it is He who spread the earth and placed therein firmly set mountains and rivers; and from all of the fruits He made therein two mates; He causes the night to cover the day. Indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought."
> — Quran 13:3

> "Then do they not look at the camels - how they are created? And at the heaven - how it is raised? And at the mountains - how they are erected? And at the earth - how it is spread out?"
> — Quran 88:17-20

**Hadith Foundations:**

> "The seeking of knowledge is obligatory for every Muslim."
> — Sunan Ibn Majah, Book 1, Hadith 224

> "Allah has not sent down any disease but that He has also sent down its cure."
> — Sahih Bukhari, Book 71, Hadith 582

> "The world is sweet and green, and Allah has made you governors over it to see how you will act."
> — Sahih Muslim, Book 42, Hadith 7068

### 2.2 Re-STEAM Framework Integration

The Re-STEAM framework (Religion + STEAM) provides the structural foundation for integrating Islamic perspectives across science education:
