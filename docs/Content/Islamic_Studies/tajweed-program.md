## 1. Overview

The Tajweed program at Smart Academy is designed to teach students the proper rules and pronunciation for Quranic recitation. Tajweed, meaning "to improve" or "to make better," is the set of rules governing the way in which the words of the Quran should be pronounced during recitation. Our program ensures that students learn to recite the Quran with beauty, accuracy, and reverence, following the prophetic tradition of Quranic recitation.

### 1.1 Philosophy

The Tajweed program is founded on these fundamental principles:

- **Divine Preservation**: The Quran was revealed with specific rules of recitation, and preserving these rules is part of preserving the Quran itself. Allah (SWT) states in Quran 73:4: "And recite the Quran with measured recitation."

- **Prophetic Tradition**: The Prophet (PBUH) received the Quran from Angel Jibreel (AS) and recited it with specific rules that were passed down through generations. Aisha (RA) reported that the Prophet (PBUH) said: "The one who recites the Quran proficiently is with the noble, righteous scribes." (Sahih Bukhari, Book 61, Hadith 546)

- **Beauty and Reverence**: Proper Tajweed enhances the beauty of Quranic recitation and demonstrates reverence for Allah's words. The Prophet (PBUH) said: "Beautify the Quran with your voices." (Sunan Abu Dawud, Book 8, Hadith 1468)

- **Accuracy in Meaning**: Proper pronunciation ensures accurate understanding of Quranic meanings. Incorrect pronunciation can change the meaning of words and verses.

- **Lifelong Skill**: Tajweed is a skill that students will use throughout their lives, enhancing their relationship with the Quran.

### 1.2 Goals

The Tajweed program aims to achieve the following goals:

1. **Correct Pronunciation**: Enable students to pronounce all Arabic letters correctly from their proper points of articulation (Makharij).

2. **Rule Application**: Teach students to apply all Tajweed rules correctly during Quranic recitation.

3. **Fluent Recitation**: Develop fluency in Quranic recitation with proper Tajweed.

4. **Self-Correction**: Train students to identify and correct their own Tajweed errors.

5. **Teaching Capability**: Prepare students to teach Tajweed to others, continuing the chain of transmission.

6. **Appreciation of Beauty**: Foster appreciation for the beauty of Quranic recitation with proper Tajweed.

7. **Integration**: Integrate Tajweed learning with Quran memorization and comprehension.
