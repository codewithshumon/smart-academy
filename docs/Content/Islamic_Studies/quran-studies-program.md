## 1. Overview

The Quran Studies program at Smart Academy is the cornerstone of our Islamic education, designed to help students develop a deep, personal relationship with the Holy Quran. This program encompasses Quran recitation, understanding, memorization, and practical application of Quranic teachings in daily life. Our approach combines traditional methods of Quranic education with modern pedagogical techniques to ensure students not only learn to read the Quran but also understand its meaning and implement its guidance.

### 1.1 Philosophy

The Quran Studies program is founded on these fundamental principles:

- **Divine Origin**: The Quran is the literal word of Allah (SWT), revealed to Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) through Angel Jibreel (AS). As stated in Quran 15:9: "Indeed, it is We who sent down the Quran and indeed, We will be its guardian."

- **Complete Guidance**: The Quran provides comprehensive guidance for all aspects of life. As Allah (SWT) states in Quran 2:2: "This is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for those conscious of Allah."

- **Recitation with Reverence**: The Quran must be recited with proper Tajweed, understanding, and reverence. Allah (SWT) commands in Quran 73:4: "And recite the Quran with measured recitation."

- **Practical Application**: Learning the Quran is not merely an academic exercise; it must be implemented in daily life. As stated in Quran 39:18: "They are the ones who listen to the word and follow the best of it."

- **Lifelong Journey**: Quranic learning is a continuous process that extends beyond formal education. The Prophet (PBUH) said: "The best among you are those who learn the Quran and teach it." (Sahih Bukhari, Book 61, Hadith 545)

### 1.2 Goals

The Quran Studies program aims to achieve the following goals:

1. **Recitation Proficiency**: Enable students to recite the Quran fluently with proper Tajweed and pronunciation.

2. **Comprehension**: Develop understanding of Quranic Arabic and the meanings of Quranic verses.

3. **Memorization**: Support students in memorizing portions or the entire Quran through our Hifz program.

4. **Implementation**: Guide students to apply Quranic teachings in their daily lives, character, and decision-making.

5. **Love for Quran**: Foster a deep love and connection with the Quran that lasts a lifetime.

6. **Teaching Capability**: Prepare students to teach Quran to others, continuing the chain of transmission.

7. **Integration**: Connect Quranic teachings with other academic subjects and real-world contexts.
