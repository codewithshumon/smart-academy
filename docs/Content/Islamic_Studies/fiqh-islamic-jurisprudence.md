## 1. Overview

The Fiqh (Islamic Jurisprudence) program at Smart Academy is designed to teach students the practical rulings and guidance derived from the Quran and Sunnah. Fiqh provides detailed understanding of how to implement Islamic teachings in daily life, covering worship, transactions, family life, and all aspects of human behavior. Our program guides students from basic understanding of Islamic rulings to comprehensive study of Fiqh, enabling them to practice Islam correctly in all aspects of life.

### 1.1 Philosophy

The Fiqh program is founded on these fundamental principles:

- **Divine Guidance**: Fiqh is derived from Allah's (SWT) guidance in the Quran and Prophet's (PBUH) Sunnah. Allah (SWT) states in Quran 4:59: "O you who have believed, obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you."

- **Practical Application**: Fiqh is not merely theoretical knowledge; it must be implemented in daily life. The Prophet (PBUH) said: "Whoever Allah wants good for, He gives him understanding of the religion." (Sahih Bukhari, Book 3, Hadith 71)

- **Moderation (Wasatiyyah)**: Islam encourages moderation in all matters. Allah (SWT) states in Quran 2:143: "And thus We have made you a just community that you will be witnesses over the people."

- **Ease and Mercy**: Islamic rulings are based on ease and mercy, not hardship. Allah (SWT) states in Quran 2:185: "Allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship."

- **Contextual Understanding**: Fiqh rulings must be understood in their proper context, considering time, place, and circumstances.

### 1.2 Goals

The Fiqh program aims to achieve the following goals:

1. **Fiqh Knowledge**: Enable students to learn Islamic rulings at an appropriate level for their age and development.

2. **Practical Implementation**: Guide students to implement Fiqh rulings in their daily lives, worship, and transactions.

3. **Understanding of Evidence**: Teach students the evidence (Dalil) behind Fiqh rulings from Quran and Sunnah.

4. **Contemporary Application**: Help students apply Fiqh to contemporary issues and modern life.

5. **Moderation**: Foster understanding of Islamic moderation and balance in all matters.

6. **Critical Thinking**: Develop students' ability to understand the wisdom (Hikmah) behind Fiqh rulings.

7. **Teaching Capability**: Prepare students to explain Fiqh rulings to others.

8. **Integration**: Connect Fiqh with Quran, Sunnah, and other Islamic studies.
