## 1. Overview

This document outlines Smart Academy's comprehensive framework for integrating Islamic values across the curriculum. The framework is grounded in the belief that education is not merely about acquiring knowledge but about developing character rooted in Islamic values. Through the Re-STEAM framework (Religion + STEAM), students learn to embody Islamic values in all aspects of their academic and personal lives.

### 1.1 Philosophy

The Islamic values framework at Smart Academy is based on several fundamental principles:

- **Tawhid (Oneness of Allah)**: All values originate from the recognition of Allah's oneness and sovereignty. Character development begins with proper understanding of Tawhid.
- **Taqwa (God-Consciousness)**: Values are internalized through consciousness of Allah and awareness that He sees all actions.
- **Ihsan (Excellence)**: Striving for excellence in all actions, knowing that Allah loves those who do good.
- **Balance**: Integrating values across all subjects while maintaining academic excellence and spiritual growth.
- **Holistic Development**: Nurturing the intellectual, spiritual, moral, and social dimensions of each student.

### 1.2 Goals

The Islamic values framework aims to achieve the following goals:

**Knowledge Goals:**
- Understand core Islamic values from Quran and Sunnah
- Learn the foundations of Islamic character development
- Recognize how values apply to all academic subjects
- Understand the importance of values in personal and professional life

**Skills Goals:**
- Apply Islamic values in daily life and academic work
- Make decisions based on Islamic principles

**Character Goals:**
