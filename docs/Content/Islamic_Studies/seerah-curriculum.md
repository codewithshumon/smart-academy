## 1. Overview

The Seerah (biography of Prophet Muhammad PBUH) program at Smart Academy is designed to introduce students to the life, character, and teachings of the final Prophet of Islam. Seerah provides a comprehensive understanding of how Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) implemented Islam in his daily life, faced challenges, and established the Islamic community. Our program guides students from simple stories of the Prophet's life to comprehensive study of his biography, enabling students to learn from his example and develop love and reverence for him.

### 1.1 Philosophy

- **Love and Reverence**: Learning Seerah fosters love and reverence for Prophet (PBUH). The Prophet (PBUH) said: "None of you truly believes until I am more beloved to him than his father, his children, and all people." (Sahih Bukhari, Book 2, Hadith 14)

- **Practical Example**: Seerah provides practical examples of how to implement Islamic teachings in daily life. The Prophet (PBUH) was described as "a walking Quran" by Aisha (RA).

- **Historical Context**: Understanding Seerah requires understanding the historical context of 7th century Arabia and the challenges faced by early Muslims.

4. **Practical Application**: Guide students to apply lessons from Seerah in their daily lives, character, and decision-making.

5. **Love for Prophet**: Foster deep love and reverence for Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).

6. **Critical Thinking**: Develop students' ability to reflect on and analyze events from Seerah.
