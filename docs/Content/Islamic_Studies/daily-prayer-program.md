## 1. Overview

The Daily Prayer Program at Smart Academy establishes a structured framework for students to develop consistent Salah (prayer) habits, fostering spiritual discipline and connection with Allah (SWT). This program integrates prayer into the daily school routine, ensuring students understand the importance, methodology, and spiritual significance of each of the five daily prayers.

### 1.1 Philosophy

The program is founded on the Quranic command:

> "Indeed, prayer has been decreed upon the believers at specified times." - Quran 4:103

And the prophetic tradition:

> "The first matter that the slave will be brought to account for on the Day of Judgment is the prayer. If it is sound, then the rest of his deeds will be sound. And if it is bad, then the rest of his deeds will be bad." - Sunan at-Tirmidhi, Book 2, Hadith 413

### 1.2 Goals
