## 1. Overview

The Hadith Studies program at Smart Academy is designed to introduce students to the sayings, actions, and approvals of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), which serve as the second most important source of Islamic guidance after the Quran. Hadith (plural: Ahadith) provides detailed explanations of Quranic teachings and practical examples of how the Prophet (PBUH) implemented Islam in his daily life. Our program guides students from basic understanding of simple Ahadith to comprehensive study of authentic Hadith collections.

### 1.1 Philosophy

The Hadith program is founded on these fundamental principles:

- **Prophetic Guidance**: Hadith is the practical explanation of the Quran. The Prophet (PBUH) said: "I have been given the Quran and something similar to it along with it." (Sunan Abu Dawud, Book 42, Hadith 4604)

- **Authenticity**: Only authentic Ahadith (Sahih) are taught to ensure students receive reliable guidance. The Prophet (PBUH) said: "Convey from me, even if it is one verse." (Sahih Bukhari, Book 73, Hadith 173)

- **Practical Application**: Hadith is not merely theoretical knowledge; it must be implemented in daily life. The Prophet (PBUH) was described as "a walking Quran" by Aisha (RA).

- **Love and Reverence**: Learning Hadith fosters love and reverence for the Prophet (PBUH). Allah (SWT) states in Quran 33:21: "There has certainly been for you in the Messenger of Allah an excellent pattern."

- **Chain of Transmission**: Understanding the Isnad (chain of narrators) is essential for verifying the authenticity of Hadith.

### 1.2 Goals

The Hadith program aims to achieve the following goals:

1. **Hadith Knowledge**: Enable students to learn and understand authentic Ahadith at an appropriate level for their age and development.

2. **Prophetic Biography**: Help students understand the life and character of the Prophet (PBUH) through his sayings and actions.

3. **Practical Implementation**: Guide students to apply Hadith teachings in their daily lives, character, and decision-making.

4. **Authenticity Understanding**: Teach students the importance of authentic Hadith and the basics of Hadith verification.

5. **Love for Prophet**: Foster love and reverence for the Prophet (PBUH) through learning his teachings.

6. **Critical Thinking**: Develop students' ability to reflect on and analyze Hadith meanings.

7. **Teaching Capability**: Prepare students to explain Hadith teachings to others.

8. **Integration**: Connect Hadith with Quran, other Islamic studies, and academic subjects.
