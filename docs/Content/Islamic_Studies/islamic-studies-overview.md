## 1. Overview

The Islamic Studies program at Smart Academy forms the foundation of our educational philosophy, providing students with authentic Islamic knowledge rooted in the Quran and Sunnah. This comprehensive program integrates Islamic teachings with modern academic excellence through our Re-STEAM (Religion + STEAM) framework, nurturing students who are both spiritually grounded and intellectually prepared for the challenges of the modern world.

### 1.1 Philosophy

Our Islamic Studies program is built upon the following core principles:

- **Tawhid-Centric Learning**: All knowledge begins and ends with the recognition of Allah's (SWT) oneness. Every subject is taught through the lens of Tawhid, helping students see Allah's signs (Ayat) in creation and knowledge.

- **Sunnah-Based Education**: The teachings and practices of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) serve as the ultimate model for character development, learning, and daily conduct.

- **Holistic Development**: We nurture the intellectual, spiritual, moral, and physical dimensions of each student, recognizing that true education encompasses the whole person.

- **Practical Application**: Islamic knowledge is not merely theoretical; students learn to apply Islamic principles in their daily lives, relationships, and future careers.

- **Age-Appropriate Pedagogy**: Content and teaching methods are carefully adapted to match the developmental stages of children from ages 3 to 16.

### 1.2 Goals

The Islamic Studies program aims to achieve the following goals:

1. **Islamic Identity Formation**: Help students develop a strong, confident Islamic identity that guides their choices and behaviors throughout life.

3. **Hifz Excellence**: Provide structured support for students who aspire to memorize the entire Quran, with 15 Huffaz already completed and 45 students currently in the program.

4. **Islamic Knowledge Base**: Build comprehensive understanding of Aqidah (Islamic creed), Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), Hadith, Seerah, Islamic history, and Akhlaq (Islamic character).

5. **Character Development**: Instill Islamic values such as Sabr (patience), Shukr (gratitude), Amanah (trustworthiness), Ikhlas (sincerity), Adab (respect), Tawadu (humility), Rahma (compassion), and Jihad (striving for excellence).

6. **Arabic Language Proficiency**: Develop Arabic language skills to enable direct understanding of Quranic and Islamic texts.

7. **Integration with Modern Education**: Demonstrate how Islamic teachings complement and enhance understanding of science, technology, and other academic subjects.

8. **Community Leadership**: Prepare students to become positive contributors to their communities, embodying Islamic values in service to others.
