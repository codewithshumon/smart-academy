## 1. Overview

The Aqidah (Islamic Creed) program at Smart Academy is designed to teach students the fundamental beliefs of Islam, establishing a strong foundation of faith (Iman). Aqidah covers the six articles of faith: belief in Allah, His angels, His books, His prophets, the Day of Judgment, and divine decree. Our program guides students from basic understanding of Islamic beliefs to comprehensive study of Aqidah, enabling them to develop a strong, correct Islamic creed.

### 1.1 Philosophy

The Aqidah program is founded on these fundamental principles:

- **Tawhid (Oneness of Allah)**: The foundation of Islamic creed is the absolute oneness of Allah (SWT). Allah (SWT) states in Quran 112:1-4: "Say, 'He is Allah, [who is] One, Allah, the Eternal Refuge. He neither begets nor is born, nor is there to Him any equivalent.'"

- **Correct Belief**: Correct Aqidah is essential for salvation. The Prophet (PBUH) said: "The most important matter is Islam, its pillar is prayer, and its peak is Jihad." (Sunan at-Tirmidhi)

- **Understanding with Evidence**: Islamic beliefs must be understood with evidence from Quran and Sunnah, not blind following.

- **Love and Reverence**: Correct Aqidah fosters love and reverence for Allah (SWT) and His creation.

- **Practical Application**: Correct beliefs must lead to correct actions and character.

### 1.2 Goals

The Aqidah program aims to achieve the following goals:

1. **Creed Knowledge**: Enable students to learn Islamic beliefs at an appropriate level for their age and development.

2. **Tawhid Understanding**: Help students develop deep understanding of Tawhid (Oneness of Allah).

3. **Evidence-Based Belief**: Teach students the evidence for Islamic beliefs from Quran and Sunnah.

4. **Refutation of False Beliefs**: Enable students to understand and refute false beliefs and innovations (Bid'ah).

5. **Practical Application**: Guide students to apply correct beliefs in their daily lives and character.

6. **Spiritual Development**: Foster spiritual development through correct beliefs.

7. **Teaching Capability**: Prepare students to explain Islamic beliefs to others.

8. **Integration**: Connect Aqidah with Quran, Sunnah, and other Islamic studies.

### 1.3 Program Structure

The Aqidah program progresses through three developmental levels:
