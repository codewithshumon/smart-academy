This program focuses on age-appropriate Islamic songs that praise Allah, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), and Islamic values, fostering spiritual connection and artistic expression within Islamic guidelines.

### 1.1 Philosophy

Nasheed (Islamic vocal music) is a beautiful form of praising Allah and expressing Islamic values:

> "And We have certainly given you seven of the often repeated [verses] and the great Quran." - Quran 15:87

The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) appreciated beautiful voices and poetry:

> "The most beautiful voice is the voice of the one who recites the Quran while making it weep." - Sunan an-Nasa'i, Book 8, Hadith 1025

The companions of the Prophet (peace be upon him) would recite poetry and nasheeds to express their love for Islam and to motivate each other in good deeds.
