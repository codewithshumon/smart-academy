## 1. Overview

This document outlines Smart Academy's approach to integrating Islamic perspectives into history education. The integration is grounded in the belief that history is not merely a record of past events but a source of divine lessons (Ibrah) and guidance for humanity. Through the Re-STEAM framework (Religion + STEAM), students learn to view historical events through an Islamic worldview, understanding the rise and fall of civilizations as manifestations of Allah's wisdom and justice.

### 1.1 Philosophy

- **Tawhid (Oneness of Allah)**: All historical events occur under Allah's knowledge and decree. History reveals Allah's consistent patterns in human affairs.
- **Ibrah (Lessons)**: History provides valuable lessons for guidance. The Quran repeatedly commands reflection on past civilizations.
- **Adl (Justice)**: Allah's justice is manifest in historical events. Nations rise and fall based on their deeds and adherence to truth.
- **Sabq (Precedent)**: Past events provide precedents for understanding present circumstances and preparing for the future.
- **Ummah (Community)**: Islamic history emphasizes the importance of community, unity, and collective responsibility.
- **Balance**: History education balances understanding of Islamic heritage with appreciation of other civilizations' contributions.

## 2. Integration Philosophy

### 2.1 Islamic Foundations

The integration of Islamic perspectives in history education is founded on authentic Islamic sources:

**Quranic Foundations:**

> "Indeed, in the stories of the prophets, there is a lesson for people of understanding. It is not a fabricated narration but a confirmation of what came before it and a detailed explanation of all things and guidance and mercy for a people who believe."
> — Quran 12:111

> "So have they not traveled through the earth and observed how was the end of those before them? They were greater than them in strength and in the traces on the land, but Allah seized them for their sins. And they had not from Allah any protector."
> — Quran 40:21

> "And We certainly sent Moses with Our signs, [saying], 'Bring out your people from darknesses into the light and remind them of the days of Allah.' Indeed in that are signs for everyone patient and grateful."
> — Quran 14:5

> "Then We gave Moses the Scripture, making complete [Our favor] upon the one who did good, and as a detailed explanation of all things and as guidance and mercy that perhaps in the meeting with their Lord they would believe."
> — Quran 6:154

**Hadith Foundations:**

> "The best of people are those of my generation, then those who follow them, then those who follow them."
> — Sahih Bukhari, Book 48, Hadith 819

> "Whoever holds fast to my Sunnah when my Ummah becomes corrupt will have the reward of a hundred martyrs."
> — Sunan al-Tirmidhi, Book 46, Hadith 3680

> "The parable of the believers in their affection, mercy, and compassion for each other is that of a body. When any limb aches, the whole body reacts with sleeplessness and fever."
> — Sahih Bukhari, Book 73, Hadith 226

### 2.2 Re-STEAM Framework Integration
