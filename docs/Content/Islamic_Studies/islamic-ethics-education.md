- **Adab (Etiquette)**: Proper conduct and respect in all interactions, reflecting Islamic manners.
- **Amanah (Trust)**: Fulfilling trusts and responsibilities with integrity and accountability.

## 2. Integration Philosophy

### 2.1 Islamic Foundations

The integration of Islamic ethics is founded on authentic Islamic sources:

> — Quran 4:58

> "And speak to people good [words] and establish prayer and give Zakah."
> — Quran 2:83

> "O you who have believed, avoid much [negative] assumption. Indeed, some assumption is sin. And do not spy or backbite each other, and do not backbite each other. Would one of you like to eat the flesh of his brother when dead? You would detest it."
> — Quran 49:12

> "And the servants of the Most Merciful are those who walk upon the earth easily, and when the ignorant address them [harshly], they say [words of] peace."
> — Quran 25:63

> — Quran 65:2-3

> — Sunan al-Tirmidhi, Book 46, Hadith 1162

> "None of you truly believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself."
> — Sahih Bukhari, Book 2, Hadith 12

> "The strong person is not the one who can wrestle someone else down. The strong person is the one who can control himself when he is angry."
> — Sahih Bukhari, Book 73, Hadith 135

> "Truthfulness leads to righteousness, and righteousness leads to Paradise."
> — Sahih Bukhari, Book 73, Hadith 104

> "Your smile in the face of your brother is charity."
> — Sunan al-Tirmidhi, Book 37, Hadith 1956
